# RefMasker
Mask homologies in fasta reference sequences based on an user provided ranking (IN DEVELOPMENT)

The order of references is CRITICAL
# if you want to perform a reference masking since it will
# start by the last reference masked by all the others then the penultimate masked by
# all others except the last and and so on until there is only one reference remaining
